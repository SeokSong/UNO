# UNO
Hello this is my single player version of UNO, it was a solo project written in C++
The last card text file is required as the file will constantly read and write to that file every turn
The game.cpp file is just the main function
The Uno.cpp is the full game that is playable, it still has bugs however it is semiplayable
